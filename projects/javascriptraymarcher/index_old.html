<h2>Javascript Raymarcher</h2>
<pre id=markdown>

##Raymarcher

This is a javascript raymarcher.  It marches rays.  This is in contrast to a raytracer, which traces rays.  Raytracers are much faster than raymarchers, often several thousand times faster.  However, raymarchers can make more interesting pictures, such as fractals or other complex shapes.

This is an [ online demo ](ver14.html) and [showcase] (gallery.html).

In addition, all the previous versions are available online, with commentary.  I have been trying to turn them into a mini tutorial, as each version is still functional and shos off a new feature.

1. We draw [a plane](ver1.html).  We have to start somewhere.
2. [Something to look at](ver2.html).  Colouring by normals, a projection and a wavy plane.
3. [Diffuse shading](ver3.html).  It is beginning to look like a real renderer now.
4. [Render primitives](ver4.html).  I add the ability to render spheres, and tidy up the code so that it will be easier to add more in the future.
5. [Shadows](ver5.html).  Things in the scene now cast shadows.
6. [Coloured lights](ver6.html).  Any surface not in shadow takes on the colours of the lights shining on it.
7. [Fractals](ver7.html).  Added the Mandelbrot fractal as a render primitive.
8. [Rotations](ver8.html). Added rotation code for camera and vectors.  Code cleanup to make primitives into javascript objects.
9. [MD2 Loader](ver9.html).  Added routines to load and render quake MD2 models.  Runs slowly but renders correctly.  Textures not supported.
10. [Diagnostic displays](ver10.html).  Added display window to show rendering hotspots (areas that take longer to render are brighter red).  Also a normal map.

jsRayMarch uses object polymorphism for all its display primitives, which simplifies the code.  All render primitives accept the following arguments.

Primitive (x,y,z,scale,Red,Green,Blue)
The primitives available are

<pre>
Sphere
BlobCylinder
Cylinder( x1, y1, z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3,radius, red, blue, green)
Lsystem
PointCloud
Triangle ( x1, y1, z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3,thickness, red, blue, green) 
Tetrahedron ( x1, y1, z1, x2,y2,z2, x3,y3,z3,thickness, green, blue, green) 
Terrain - everything y<0
Square - actually a cube, radius is from centre to face of cube.
