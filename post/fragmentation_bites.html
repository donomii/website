<p>Defragmenting your drives used to be a big thing.  There were lots of utilities you could buy that promised to make your drive go faster, work more efficiently and store more.</p>
<p>Long, excruciatingly boring articles in print magazines warned naive users that we should defragment our drives weekly, or daily, or whatever.  Users would advise each other constantly.  &quot;You should defragment your drives daily&quot; &quot;Oh yes, that's very important&quot;.</p>
<p>It wasn't important, but people did it anyway.  And then Operating Systems got better and nobody ever had to do it again.  Until today.</p>
<p>My faithful SQLite database, which I had been using for several years, stopped working with a &quot;disk I/O error&quot;.  When I enabled more logging with</p>
<pre><code>.log stderr
</code></pre>
<p>I saw</p>
<pre><code>(1034) os_win.c:32118: (665) winSync(H:\mydb\json.sqlite) - The requested operation could not be completed due to a file system limitation
</code></pre>
<p>Panicking just a little bit, because it held 125 Gib of data that wasn't backed up, I checked on line to discover that &quot;A heavily fragmented file in an NTFS volume may not grow beyond a certain size &quot;.</p>
<p>So for the first time in 20 years, I am actually running &quot;defrag&quot;.  But now I'm doing it on a 2 Tb USB drive, so it is actually taking longer than my original 2Mib hard drive.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>PostScript: It took more than a week!</p>
